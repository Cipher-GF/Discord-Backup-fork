The automation of Discord Accounts also known as self-bots is a violation of Discord Terms of Service & Community Guidelines and will result in your account(s) being terminated.

## Notes / FAQ:
### Restoring Servers + Group Chats + Server Folders
Because of Discord's last resorts of using hCaptcha to stop people self-botting on Discord, I've decided its best to stop this program needing a captcha key.
- The program will create a server with all the old server invites in them, sorted into the folders from the old account.
- You simply just join them, when you need to.
- After you have joined all the servers, you can use the restore module to only restore folders.

### Group Chat Invites
Group Chat Invites are a bit scuffed on Discord.
- Server Invites will still be active if you leave the server.
- However, Group Chat Invites will not work **if you leave** the Group Chat.
- Meaning, if you leave the group chat after a backup, and before a term, then you won't be able to join that group chat back.


### Can I backup/restore an account which is already termed?
No. You can't, and never will be able to. Stop asking this.
